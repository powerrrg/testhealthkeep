<p>HealthKeep is a modern social networking platform available on the web and mobile devices.  In some ways itâ€™s like Facebook, Twitter or Google+, except it is only about your health.</p>

<p>When you go through health experiences and health events or watch as your loved one does, it can be difficult, hard to understand and stressful.</p>

<p>Oftentimes traditional Internet searches lead to the wrong and scary diagnoses, and many health websites produce complex articles filled with jargon that are hard for non health professionals to understand.</p>

<p>On HealthKeep you simply post a health experience. It can be something you are currently going through, or something you already went through.  It can be about you or someone you care about.  It can be a story, a difficult moment, a diagnosis, a surgery or a question.</p>

<p>After you enter your experience, you can then see other experiences related to yours that others have been though.  You can receive comments and support on your experience.  You will get real world feedback from people just like you.</p>

<p>You can also create a simple personal profile sort of like a personal health chart.  You can add symptoms you have, medications you take, as well as your medical conditions and surgeries.  You can also add your doctor.</p>

<p>HealthKeep is totally and completely anonymous.  We do not take your real name or any personally identifiable information.  You are given a random screen name and faceless avatar, though you can customize these if you wish.</p>

<p>Since its completely anonymous you can share about whatever sensitive issues you wish with no fear anyone can know who you are.  This makes HealthKeep HIPAA-compliant, a government rule to keep your sensitive health issues private.</p>

<p>Once you have a profile you can view a continuous stream of real-time personalized news about all your health issues.  You will also receive a stream of new experiences related to you that others are sharing.</p>

<p>You can always share new health experiences as they occur such as a new symptom, medication, upcoming surgery or diagnosis, and get feedback from what others who have gone through the same thing have said before.</p>

<p>HealthKeep is simple, compassionate, helpful and free.  Sign up today!</p>
